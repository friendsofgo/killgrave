# Contributing

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing to Killgrave. We are so happy that you are interested in our project,
so we want to offer some guidelines before you start.

## Code of Conduct

## Questions

Also, we share announcements related with the tool on this channel.

## Getting Started

### Filing a bug or feature 

Before filing an issue, please check the existing [issues](https://github.com/friendsofgo/killgrave/issues) to see if a similar one was already opened. If there is one already opened, feel free to comment on it.

If you believe you've found a bug, please provide detailed steps of reproduction, the version of Killgrave, the imposters that are involved and anything else you believe will be useful to help troubleshoot it (e.g. OS environment, config file, flags, etc...). Also, state the current behavior vs. the expected behavior.

If you'd like to see a feature or an enhancement please open an issue with a clear title and description of what the feature is and why it would be beneficial to the project and its users. Remember that you can also
discuss with the community about the new features on the [#killgrave slack channel](https://gophers.slack.com/archives/C01CJCP04E8).

### Working on issues

Killgrave releases work using [milestones](https://github.com/friendsofgo/killgrave/milestones), if you see that some issue doesn't have
any milestone it is possible that the issue has not been reviewed yet by any maintainer or the issue could be integrated in master 
without any impact, ie. a typo fix on the README.

Each milestone has his own [branch](https://github.com/friendsofgo/killgrave/branches), so you will need to wait until the issue has been assigned to a milestone before you start your work, because you will need to base your changes on that branch.

Before you start, please ask in the issue if you can take it and request for a milestone if no milestone has been assigned yet.

Now, you are ready to contribute to make Killgrave the best mock tool in the world! [Fork Killgrave](https://github.com/friendsofgo/killgrave/fork) and start!!
